I have been trying to install and run ArchLinux on my ageing laptop. The two reasons being

1. My laptop has become sluggish and non-responsive. This is mostly because of age and my existing Mint   Cinnamon installation was taking way too much resources. I had tried other distros (Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE) and DEs (Gnome, KDE) in the past but most were very heavy on the system. Arch gives you a barebones stripped down OS. You install only what you really need. Couple this up with a lightweight DE, such as XFCE or LXDE, or even lighter WM, such as OpenBox and you have got yourself a snappy little setup that works great on an old system.

2. Learning curve of Linux system is steep. But that curve gradually flattens out after a few months (or years). Using various flavors of Linux off and on for the past couple of years, I felt the curve has flattened out for me. I wanted to experiment. I wanted to learn more. 

Building up the entire system, configuring each and every component, right from the touchpad to internet to bluetooth speakers, has been truly a learning experience. The curve has again gained slope. This is the true advantage of ArchLinux. And because of the amazing community and legendary [wiki pages](https://wiki.archlinux.org), you would not be lost. And even if you are lost, you will come out more knowledgeable and experienced. 

Over the past week, I have learnt a great deal about Linux systems, and I am thankful to ArchLinux for that. I will try to share the things I have learnt in subsequent posts.
